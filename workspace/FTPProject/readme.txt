This application continously scans files placed in the root directory of the FTP Server and moves them into directories based on their
timestamp.

So, when a new image is loaded into the root directory, it gets placed into the directory.

To make it startup on startup
Press Windows+R to open the “Run” dialog box. Type “shell:startup” and then hit Enter to open the “Startup” folder. 
Create a shortcut in the “Startup” folder to any file, folder, or app's executable file. It will open on startup the next time you boot.
